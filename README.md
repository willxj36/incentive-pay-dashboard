# ðŸ“œ Incentive Pay Dashboard

&nbsp;

## ðŸ§  Purpose

This is a configurable dashboard that shows a simple visualization of how complex incentive pay systems common in LTL short-distance trucking will actually affect a driver in a practical way. V1 is based on a system this developer is familiar with from 1st hand experience with the ability to tweak basic factors to match a driver's specific system. Over time, I plan to add additional systems for more customizability while keeping the UI just as simple and easy-to-use. This is meant to be an exploration of keeping increasingly complex under-the-hood logic and user-side customizability simple, practical, and easy to understand on the frontend, while also being a legitimately useful tool for real-life scenarios and not based on contrived circumstances to fit the code.
